Hey,

I'm emailing you because I noticed that you work for Dimagi, and you're a
member of project space {{ domain_name }}. {{ domain_name }} has a lot of
submissions, but it's missing some information about the project.

If this is a test project space, go to the internal project settings page
{{ settings_link }} and change the "Real Project" setting to "Test" and I'll
stop bothering you.

If this project space does represent a new real project, let me know by
updating Country, Sector, Subsector, Organization, and Notes. You can read
more about this email on the wiki here:

Thanks!
